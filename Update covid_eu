--Creating a new table with data inclusive for Europe


CREATE TABLE covid_eu.europe AS
SELECT *
FROM 
  `covid-eu.covid_eu.world`
WHERE continent = "Europe"

--Previewing our desired table


SELECT * 
FROM `covid-eu.covid_eu.europe` 
ORDER BY 3,4

-- Exploring the probability of death when infected


SELECT
  Location,date,total_cases,total_deaths,(total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS death_percent
FROM 
  `covid-eu.covid_eu.europe`
ORDER BY 1,2


--Exploring the percentile of countries population infected in Europe


SELECT
  Location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS overall_infected, (MAX(total_cases/population)*100) AS infected_percentage
FROM
  `covid-eu.covid_eu.europe`
GROUP BY Location, population 
ORDER BY 4 DESC


--We can see that Cyprus is the highly affected country in Europe in comparison with Population


--To visualize total cases around dates


SELECT
  Location, date,population, total_cases, total_cases/population AS percentage_cases
FROM
  `covid-eu.covid_eu.europe`
ORDER BY 1,2


--Now lets find out the total cases and Deaths across all of the Europe


WITH z
AS
(
SELECT location, max(total_cases) AS a ,MAX(total_deaths) AS b
FROM `covid-eu.covid_eu.europe`
GROUP BY location
)
SELECT 
  SUM(a) AS europe_cases, SUM(b) AS europe_deaths, SUM(b)/SUM(a)*100 AS death_percent
FROM z


--pov: I just now found Russia is half European - Still in shock!


--Lets find the percentage of people vaccinated in Europe


WITH x
AS
(
SELECT 
  location, date, new_vaccinations, SUM(new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY location ORDER BY location,date) AS inc_vaccinations, population
FROM
    `covid-eu.covid_eu.europe`
)
SELECT
  SUM(DISTINCT population) AS overall_population, MAX (inc_vaccinations) AS overall_vaccinations, (MAX (inc_vaccinations))/SUM(DISTINCT population)*100 AS vaccination_percentage
  FROM x
